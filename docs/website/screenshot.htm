				<h2>Features</h2>
				<div class="entry" align="justify">
					<p>The list bellow contains the main features already implemented on Plandora:</p>
					<li><b>Multiples roles</b> into system. Project Leader, Project Resource, Customer and System Administrator (Root). Each role is associated with different features into system.</li>
					<li>The system provides <b>customer GUI</b> to open Requirements and follow the status of opened Requirements. <a href="screen/screenshot-req.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The Leader is able to <b>link one or more tasks with a request</b> and to assign it to a specific project resource.</li>
					<li>The tasks of resources can be updated and visualized by project leader in any time through a <b>Gantt chart</b>. <a href="screen/screenshot-gantt.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The project team is able to view the task and requirements through the <b>agile board</b>. This panel is useful to be used during the iteration planning or daily meetings. <a href="screen/screenshot-agile.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The task working time from the <b>resource TO DO list</b>, can be updated and will be considered dynamically by the Gantt chart and eventually will change the status of request viewed by customer requester. <a href="screen/screenshot-main.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The main form could contain <b>gadgets</b> that can be selected by user in order to improve his task or management<a href="screen/screenshot-gad.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a> </li>
					<li>The system administrator is able to configure for each project, <b>key indicators</b> (KPI) which follow the concept of <b>BSC (Balanced Scorecard)</b>. Each KPI is actually a SQL statement, and for this reason, can be easily customized for any situations. <a href="screen/screenshot-kpi.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The system administrator is able to create requirement <b>categories</b> for a specific project. It is useful to categorize types of requests (for example: if the project is in compliance with the ITIL Service Desk the categories can be set to Incidents, Problems, Changes, etc)</li>
					<li>The tool implements the concept of <b>Meta Fields</b>. A Meta Field is a visual element (text box, combo box, calendar or a SQL combo box) created by system administrator and can be related with requirements, tasks or risks of a specific project. The Meta Fields is useful to give more customization from the inputs. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/plandora/index.php?title=HowToCreateMetaFields"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The information about the projects (task, risks, issues, lesson learned, etc) are automatically indexed and can be searched through a <b>'google-like'</b> GUI, consolidating a <b>knowledge base</b> of all projects in a colaborative way and with common sharing. <a href="screen/screenshot-kb.png"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The team is able to create links between tasks or requirements and repository items, for example <b>SVN</b> files. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/plandora/index.php?title=HowToIntegrateWithSVN"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>					
					<li>The system supports <b>multiples projects</b>, where each project has one or more leaders, one or more resources and one or more customers. <a href="screen/screenshot-proj.PNG"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The Leader of project is able to check and <b>approve/refuse the requirements</b> coming from customers. The project resources won't be involved until the request is approved. <a href="screen/screenshot-refuse.jpg"><b>(see the screenshot)</b></a></li>
					<li>The Plandora tool is <b>multiplatform</b>. It is written in Java and runs in any operational system that supports the Java language.</li>
					<li>Plandora was designed and tested under a free data base (<b>MySQL</b>) and free web server (<b>Jakarta Tomcat</b>).</li>
					<li>The Plandora tool is <b>royalty free for any purposes</b>. Anyone is allowed to use, modify and resell fully or partially this system (including commercial usage). For more information, check the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</a> terms of use.</li>
