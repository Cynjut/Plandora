				<h2>Balanced Scorecard and Plandora</h2>
				<small>August 25th, 2006</small><br/>
				<div class="entry" align="justify">
					<p>In the 1990's Dr. Robert Kaplan and David Norton, from Harvard Business School developed a new 
					approach called "balanced scorecard" (BSC). This new approach provides tools to enable the 
					organizations to clarify their vision about the current company situation and to transform the 
					metrics in actions for continuously improvement.</p>			
					<p>Today, many companies are adopting the BSC to monitoring the strategic goals. The BSC suggest four perspectives: "Financial Perspective", "Customer Perspective", "Business Process Perspective" and "Learning and Growth Perspective".</p>
					<p>The Plandora enables the project managers or leaders to create and view metrics related to the tool (projects, 
					tasks, requests, resources, etc). Those KPI's (Key Performance Indicator) can supply information to help the 
					stakeholder's strategy for a specific project or even provides information to feed the company BSC.</p>
					<p>To learn how the Plandora BSC can help your company, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/plandora/wiki/HowToCreateKPI/" title="How to Create a KPI">click here</a>.</p>
					<p>To learn more about BSC visit the <a href="http://www.balancedscorecard.org/basics/bsc1.html" title="www.balancedscorecard.org">oficial site</a> about it

				<h2>Customized Fields for Customized Purposes</h2>
				<small>July 25th, 2006</small><br/>
				<div class="entry" align="justify">
					<p>Nowadays, the companies demand systems that are able to supply features for specific purposes. 
					In workflow tools, is important to create screens that collect as maximum as possible information from the customer (requirement, tasks, etc) in order to improve a data base with information about the project's history and the company's knowledge.</p>
					<p>Plandora, since version 0.9.1 implements the approach of Meta Fields to address this issue. Meta Fields are dynamic GUI resources generated and configured to display into the forms any information with customized appearance.</p> 
					<p>For more information of how to create a meta field in your Plandora's project, see the link <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/plandora/wiki/HowToCreateKPI/" title="How to Create a Meta Field">here</a>.

We introduced the new Plandora logo, a new color style and the content of web site in English idiom (this project was originally conceived in Brazilian Portuguese). Our purpose is to improve a communication channel with the development community and the system users.</p>
					<p>Besides, at this month (July,2006) we complete two years since the first version of system was released, and all this period more than one thousands of downloads was performed. For this reason, we believe that there are an enormous public looking forward for good workflow tools, and Plandora wants to be one of those tools, with the advantage to be open-source and royalty-free..</p>
					<p>The next steps are to open an area for FAQs about the system usages and a specific area to support the developers that eventually wants to help us.</p>
					<p>We hope you enjoy the show!</p>
