# Plandora
Plandora Project Management System

This is a reboot of Plandora, the now 10 year old Project Planning and Management suite. Make no mistake - this project is based on the excellent work of the previous Plandora team and we wouldn't be able to manage what we hope will become an improved system without their work and dedication. Having said that, with the original author MIA and unable to answer questions, I needed a place to put the source code so that I could fix problems as I find them.

The first change was to correctly spell the word "requirement" everyplace it appears. After that, all bets are off as to what will get fixed next.

A few things that I've already fixed are documented below.

My big impetus for this is actually documentation, which I hope to start working on shortly. If there is a single problem with Plandora, it's the rather resounding lack of anything but design documentation. For example, the Workflow wizard (which in itself appears to be an awesome addition) doesn't have anything like code reviews or other milestones. There are also several pieces that really need to get written from a 'getting started' perspective, including all of the simple forms for updating functions, areas, and other components. 

In addition to the internals of the system, we are also looking at providing integration of "RT4" with the system, allowing existing RT installations to use Plandora as a mechanism for tracking and monitoring projects based on trouble ticketing. This will simplify life for many people, since the public face of the system for "non-resources" will now be external to the development process.

Version 1.13.1

==> Fixes
- replaced all occurrences of the word 'requeriment' with 'requirement'. Sorry, it was driving me nuts.
- added (documented) support for Java version 8. The system now builds correctly in Eclipse and runs under the Java 1.8 JRE and JDK. Special note - I hoisted myself on my own petard here; I don't have a NetBSD server that runs the 1.8 JRE yet.
