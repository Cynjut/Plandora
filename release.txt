Nesta versao a possavel criar meta campos do tipo: textBox, ComboBox (com dados estaticos) e SQLComboBox (com dados vindos de uma SQL pre-definida). Por enquanto a possivel apenas criar meta campos para a tela de solicitaaao. Este tipo de funcionalidade a bastante atil caso se necessite customizar a entrada de dados de determinado projeto (por exemplo: campo para guardar o nome da versao em que se encontrou um bug, etc). Os metacampos cadastrados aparecem tambam na tela de "Todas as Solicitacoes" visto pelo lader.
- Para o usuario lader, na tela de preferencias, a possavel exibir/esconder campos da tela de "Todas as Solicitacoes". Isto foi implementado devido a grande quantidade de campos existente hoje. Sendo assim, o praprio lider pode customizar os campos que deseja exibir de acordo com as suas necessidades.
